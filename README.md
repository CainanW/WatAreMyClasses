Campus Navigation App for UW

Getting set up
---
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Current todos:

- ~~Get the nodes into something that a pathfinding algorithm can use.~~ Done (I think?)
   - ~~Find relationships between nodes.~~
      - Done, but ineficciently.
   - ~~Use the building center point as a new node.~~ Done!
   - From there, just use pathfinding from a given node to a building's node, or another path node.
      - This is of course, more complicated than it sounds
